# :atom_symbol: react-module-boilerplate

Simple boilerplate for creating a new React module.

## Why did I make this?

I'm always making small React modules, but I find that I'm constantly having to copy over code from a previous project just to get my new project setup. This repo was my idea of solving that. It's a very barebones approach to solving a simple boilerplate for React modules.

## Getting Started

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hcjk/react-module-boilerplate.git
cd react-module-boilerplate
yarn && yarn start
```
